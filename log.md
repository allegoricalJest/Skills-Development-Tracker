## Saturday 2 April 2022

Started a new course Algorithms, Part I by Princeton University on Coursera and gained a new understanding time complexity and memory usage for Union Find, Quick Union Find, and Weight Quick Union Find. Also finished the first project assignment for the course coding a percolation that can read in text files and determine if the top is connected to the bottom of the grid that is formed by open and closed cells. Had difficulties with the memory constraints and the "backwashing" of my initial implementation but ultimately find the solution by storing the state of each cell with bytes rather than boolean since they take the same amount of memory but bytes can simultaneous represent multiple states (1 for each bit) while a boolean can only represent 2 possible values.

Started Python and Statistics for Financial Analysis by The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology on Coursera. Installed Jupyter and Anaconda and worked more with Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy as well as StatsModels. It's a pretty interesting course so far and I'm interested in seeing if I can make practical use of the financial analysis strategies and coding in actual trading.

Learned about github and repositories. figured out how to implement badges and different aspects of a README.md file.
